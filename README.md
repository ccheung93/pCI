# pCI

The parallel CI/CI+MBPT/CI+all-order code package (to be named) is a high-precision relativistic atomic structure software package based on the configuration interaction (CI) method and the combination of CI with many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) or the linearized coupled-cluster (all-order) method. The serial codes were published by [Kozlov *et al*.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001046551500185X) and parallel codes have been developed and are currently maintained by Dr. Marianna Safronova's group at the University of Delaware in Newark, DE, USA.
