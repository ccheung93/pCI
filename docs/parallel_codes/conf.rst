conf
----

Before you run ``conf``, make sure the following input files have been appropriately generated by ``hfd``, ``bass``, ``add``, and ``basc``:

- ``HFD.DAT`` (obtained from basis)
- ``CONF.INP`` (obtained from add)
- ``CONF.DAT`` (obtained from basc)
- ``CONF.GNT`` (obtained from basc)
- ``CONF.INT`` (obtained from basc)
- ``SGC.CON`` (optionally obtained from all-order) 
- ``SCRC.CON`` (optionally obtained from all-order) 

Next, you must create a file named ``c.in`` with the following parameters:

.. code-block:: 

    Kl         ! (0 - start, 1 - continue calculation, 2 - include corrections, 3 - add configurations)
    Ksig       ! (0 - pure CI, 1 - include one-electron corrections, 2 - include one- and two-electron corrections)
    Kdsig      ! (0 - no energy dependence on Sigma, 1 - energy dependence on Sigma)
    Kw         ! (0 - do not write CONF.HIJ, 1 - write CONF.HIJ)
    kLSJ       ! (0 - do not calculate expectation values of S^2 and L^2 and form approximate terms for each energy level, 1 - calculate LSJ)


To run parallel ``conf``, run the command:

.. code-block:: 

    mpirun -n <nprocs> ./conf
