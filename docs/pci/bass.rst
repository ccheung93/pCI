bass - constructing the basis set
---------------------------------

The ``bass`` program forms the DF orbitals for the core and valence shells, then adds virtual orbitals to account for correlations. A reasonable basis set should consist of orbitals mainly localized at the same distances from the origin as the valence orbitals.
